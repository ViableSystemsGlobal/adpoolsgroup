- **Data encryption** - Sensitive data not encrypted at rest
- **GDPR compliance** - No data retention policies, right to be forgotten
- **API rate limiting** - No protection against abuse
- **Input validation** - Limited server-side validation
- **SQL injection protection** - Using Prisma helps but need more validation

#### 2. Performance & Scalability
- **Database indexing** - Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Caching layer** - No Redis/memcached for frequently accessed data
- **Pagination** - Lists could be very slow with large datasets
- **Database connection pooling** - Single connection per request
- **CDN** - Static assets not optimized
- **Background job processing** - Heavy operations block UI

#### 3. Data Integrity & Backup
- **Database backups** - No automated backup strategy
- **Data validation** - Limited business rule enforcement
- **Soft deletes** - Hard deletes lose historical data
- **Data migration tools** - No versioned schema migrations
- **Referential integrity** - Some relationships could be stronger

#### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- **Error tracking** - No Sentry/error monitoring
- **Performance monitoring** - No APM tools
- **Logging** - Basic console.log, no structured logging
- **Health checks** - No system health monitoring
- **Metrics collection** - No business metrics tracking

#### 5. Advanced Features
- **Workflow automation** - No automated lead scoring, follow-ups
- **Advanced reporting** - No analytics dashboard, forecasting
- **Integration capabilities** - No webhooks, API for external systems
- **Multi-tenancy** - Single tenant system
- **Advanced search** - No full-text search, filtering
- **Bulk operations** - Limited bulk editing capabilities

#### 6. User Experience
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - No power user features
- **Advanced filtering** - Basic search only
- **Data export** - Limited export formats
- **Mobile optimization** - Could be better
- **Accessibility** - No ARIA labels, screen reader support
